1.2 About
=========

Python Mass Spec Analyzer (PyMSA) is a python package to analyze Tandem Mass Spectrometry experiments. 
It tries to give you, the user, as much control as possible. This is archieved by keeping the functions
as high leveled as possible and as such is not meant to be a one line solution for all possible MS/MS analys. 
This means that getting started might not be very straight forward, hopefully the example scripts provided
can help you on the way. The example scripts show some of the functionality to help you on the way, but I encourage 
you to go through the API documentation, as there are quite a lot of functions I'm not showing in the example scripts
which might be useful for you.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (see 1.2.1 Contact information for my details).
